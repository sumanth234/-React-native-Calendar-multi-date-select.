#React-native Calendar.

React-native Calendar with both check-in and check-out options.

This particular app will satisfy the following requirements.

    1) End date > Start date

    2) One can only select the date within a limit of one year from today

    3) You cannot select a past date. The only exception is Grace Period - 12:00 A.M. to 4:00 A.M. is known as Grace Period. If a user tries to select the date within Grace period only then he/she can select yesterday date. 

    Ex. - If a user is trying to book a room between 00:00 am and 4:00 am on 13 Apr, for the same day (from 12 pm, 12 Apr - 11 am, 13 Apr), then the user would be able to book the room for yesterday (12 Apr).
    
    

Currently this is working only in debug mode and is having some issues in release mode.I am trying to fix it.
